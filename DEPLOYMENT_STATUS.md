## ✅ Completed

### 1. Cloud Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Created `.gitignore` for security
- [x] Created `.streamlit/config.toml` for app configuration
- [x] Created `.streamlit/secrets.toml.example` as template
- [x] Modified `scoring_app.py` to use GCS for storage
- [x] Created `upload_inference_to_gcs.py` script
- [x] Created `download_scores.py` script
- [x] Updated `requirements.txt` with minimal dependencies
- [x] Created comprehensive `DEPLOY.md` guide
- [x] Created `README.md` documentation

### 2. Cloud Storage Setup
- [x] Uploaded inference run to GCS:
  - Location: `gs://buildai-dataset/inference_runs/run_20251004_135336/`
  - 22 JSON files uploaded successfully
- [x] Uploaded existing scores to GCS:
  - Location: `gs://buildai-dataset/scores/scores.csv`
  - 60 existing scores preserved

### 3. Local Testing
- [x] GCP authentication configured
- [x] Upload script tested and working
- [x] Scores synced to cloud

## 📋 Next Steps (5-10 minutes to deploy)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Cloud-enabled scoring system"
# Create repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Create Service Account (if needed)
```bash
# Create service account for Streamlit Cloud
gcloud iam service-accounts create streamlit-scorer \
    --display-name="Streamlit Scoring App" \
    --project=data-470400

# Grant permissions
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding data-470400 \
    --member="serviceAccount:streamlit-scorer@data-470400.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/storage.objectAdmin"

# Download key
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create ~/streamlit-key.json \
    --iam-account=streamlit-scorer@data-470400.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# View key (you'll paste this into Streamlit Cloud secrets)
cat ~/streamlit-key.json
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io
2. Click "New app"
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Main file: `scoring_app.py`
5. Python version: 3.11
6. Click "Advanced settings" → Add secrets from `~/streamlit-key.json`
7. Deploy!

### Step 4: Test the Deployed App
1. Open the Streamlit app URL
2. Should see: "Select Inference Run"
3. Should see: "run_20251004_135336" in dropdown
4. Test with a rater ID and score a video

### Step 5: Share with Raters
Send them:
- The Streamlit app URL
- Instructions:
  1. Select run: `run_20251004_135336`
  2. Video path: `gs://buildai-dataset/finetune_dataset/test/`
  3. Choose "Binary" mode (faster)
  4. Enter your name as Rater ID
  5. Score 3 videos

## 🎯 Current Results

**Need 2-3 more raters to reach statistical significance!**

- Finetuned: 72.2% win rate (19/27)
- Baseline: 27.8% win rate (7/27)
- p-value: 0.052 (just need a bit more data!)

## 📊 After Collecting More Scores

```bash
# Download latest scores
python download_scores.py

# Analyze
python visualize_results.py
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If the app can't find the inference run:
```bash
# Verify upload
python -c "
from google.cloud.storage import Client
bucket = Client().bucket('buildai-dataset')
blobs = list(bucket.list_blobs(prefix='inference_runs/'))
print(f'Found {len(blobs)} files')
for blob in blobs[:5]:
    print(f'  {blob.name}')
"
```

## 💰 Cost Estimate

- Streamlit Cloud: Free
- GCS Storage: < $0.10/month
- GCS Operations: < $0.01/month
- **Total: Essentially free**

## 📁 Files Ready for Deployment

All code is ready. Just need to:
1. Push to GitHub
2. Configure Streamlit Cloud secrets
3. Deploy
4. Share URL with raters

**Estimated time to live deployment: 10 minutes**
