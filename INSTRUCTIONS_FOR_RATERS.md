# Factory Task Scoring - Instructions

## What You'll Do

You'll watch 3 short factory videos (1-2 minutes each) and compare AI-generated descriptions of what's happening.

**Total time:** ~5 minutes

## How to Start

1. **Open the link** provided to you
2. **Enter your name or email** when prompted (this helps us track who scored what)
3. **Watch each video** carefully
4. **Read both descriptions** (shown in RED and YELLOW)
5. **Pick which description is better** - or say they're equally good
6. **Optional:** Add a brief note explaining your choice

## Important Notes

- The colors (RED/YELLOW) are **randomized** for each video - this is intentional for unbiased evaluation
- You'll see 3 different videos than other raters (everyone gets a random sample)
- Your responses are **saved automatically** when you click "Submit & Next Video"
- You can take breaks between videos if needed

## What Makes a Good Description?

A good description should:
- ‚úÖ Include all the important steps the worker performs
- ‚úÖ Describe actions in the correct order
- ‚úÖ Be specific about what objects/tools are being used
- ‚úÖ Focus only on what the wearer (person recording) is doing
- ‚ùå Not include made-up steps that didn't happen
- ‚ùå Not mention other people in the background
